# Virat Kohli Dashboard - Power BI Project

I developed a dynamic and interactive Power BI dashboard that visualizes key performance metrics and statistics of Indian cricketer Virat Kohli, showcasing my skills in data visualization, analysis, and Power BI expertise.

# Key features of the dashboard include:

- In-depth analysis of Virat Kohli's batting performance, including runs scored, strike rates, average, and match comparisons across various formats (ODI, Test, T20I).
- Interactive filters and slicers for users to explore data by year, format, opponent, and venue.
- Trend analysis and performance patterns over time to provide actionable insights for performance improvements.
- Visual representation of data using bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts for an engaging user experience.

This project demonstrates my ability to manipulate large datasets, create meaningful visualizations, and develop user-friendly dashboards tailored for data-driven decision-making.
